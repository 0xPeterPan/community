# Developer DAO

## Core

### Describe the DAOs goals as explicitly as possible

Developer DAO exists to accelerate the education an impact of a new wave of builders on Web3 through:

- Education
- Community building, networking & collaboration
- Building and supporting public goods

**N.B.** Assuming value creation will be a natural result of delivering on the above.

\*Depending on the direction the community ultimately takes can picture ending up as either [Service DAO](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw#service-daos) or [Social DAO](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw#social-daos), or maybe even something entirely new.

### Top 3 expected principals of this organisation

- **Transparency** (open source everything, conversations in public, document and share journey)
- **Diversity & Inclusion** (seek to foster as diverse a membership as possible and support everyone to contribute)
- **Responsibility** (as a self-governed community we rely on members to be personal responsible for their actions and commitments to the community)

### Why are we deploying as a DAO

- Organisation/coordination & Governance at scale
- Value capture & rewarding contributions

### Big picture impact of the DAO

By fostering an environment that supports achieving our mission/values/goals, Developer DAO can become the go to community for on-boarding existing Web2 engineering talent into Web3 and a platform for launching new ideas.

### What do we need to achieve our goals?

Now:

- Consensus on mission, values and goals.
- Consistent cadence for coordination and collaboration.
- Establish a core team responsible for executing the mission of the DAO on an day-to-day/ongoing basis
- System for recognising and rewarding collaboration (outside of any financial rewards).
- Process/framework for decentralised decision making based on our mission/values and goals.

Future:

- Value capture and fair distribution of ownership
- Growth of a treasury/funding to support community projects

## Community

## Project backstory

The project was started as an experiment by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) to see what can be achieved when we bring together talented and like-minded people who are interested in learning about and building on Web3.

Since launch, over 3000 NFT have been sold and over 900 of them have joined the discord server.

## Communication platforms

- **Conversations/Brainstorms:** _Discord_
- **conform discussion/Proposals/Consensus building:** _Discourse_
- **Knowledge repository:** _GitHub, developerdao.com / docs, Notion?, newsletter, Blog (multiple for different content types?), YouTube/similar_

### Communication rhythms

- **Weekly:** project/team/guild calls, Community call, Core team meeting
- **Monthly:** Town Hall
- **Quartely:** Seaons round-up / launch (replaces months town hall)

### Who is responsible?

- **Core team:** responsible for executing the mission of the DAO on an day-to-day/ongoing basis (organisation, admin, documentation, communication, shepparding governance processes). Must accept minimum commitment (TBD) to ensure smooth running of the DAO.
- **Team/Guilds/Project leads:** TBD
- **Contributors/Resource pool:** TBD

## Member journey

### Describe the new user on-boarding process

To start, the sole way of joining the community is by minting one of the D4R genesis NFTs. Any holder can then access our private discourse server and begin a simple on-boarding process to assign themselves a skill role.

We acknowledge this could be more inclusive given the associated gas fee however we believe it is best solution as this time to ensure members have "skin-in-the-game".

In the future we will review alternate routes into the DAO, potentially including:

- Bounties
- Time bound access via other NFTs
- Apprenticeship / grants

### How can new users catch up?

- Start with our [`#on-boarding`](https://discord.gg/dp3K6xea) channel in discord
- This document when it's finished / other docs we need to make
- Read through town hall and project meetings in [Community repo](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/community).
- Join open project and community calls (see [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=developerdao1@gmail.com))
- Join the conversation/begin contributing.

### How do you keep new users engaged?

_Not very well defined at the moment and we're relying heavily on individual passion and belief in the opportunity to create something_

Potential easy wins:

- Recognising contributors with defined roles
- POAP NFTs for attending meetings
- Acknowledging the contributions publicly community events
- Actively support each other via:
  - Help with learning
  - Promoting each others work

Future:

- Tracking contributions and rewarding with some representation of value, most likely in the form of a token ($DBUCKS) that corresponds to voting rights in organisation

### How does a user leave?

_Skipping for now_

## Governance elements

### From the users’ point of view, what is the DAO’s primary objective?

Provide an environment for learning, collaboration and shared value creation.

### What connects your different user personas?

Passion for technology and belief in the potential opportunities for a better world (and career) offered by Web3.

### How do users coordinate strategy, planning and direction?

Conversations → brainstorming → proposals → consensus → execution

Conversations + Brainstorming (Discord)
Proposals + consensus (Discourse/Snapshot)
Execution (Project Teams/Guilds)

### How can users leverage participation for individual benefit?

Through supporting each others learning and collaborating on DAO of personal projects, we have the opportunity to grow both as individuals and a collective. Seek support from the community for elevate your work to a wider audience.

As the community grows so will our ability to do these things and so the cycle continues.

### Describe your user personas:

- Experienced Web2 talent (all ages/levels), excited by the opportunities and innovation in Web3 looking to learn, share knowledge, build network, collaborate, get job in Web3
- Experience Web3 talent excited to share their knowledge, increase their network and find collaborators/collaborations opportunities.
- New talent, either at an early stage in their career or seeking a career change, looking for learn about Web3, get the opportunity to work on real projects, build a network and land a job in web3.

## Actors

### DAO functions

> What do you want your DAO to do?

_I think it is very early to be getting to specific however some ideas:_

- Provide framework for organisation/collaboration/decision making in a large group.
- Curate content to help wider community
- Support projects

### Ideal proposal types (brainstorm)

> These types will help determine who gets tokens and how

### If you plan on managing or allocating capital who are the funders? Why would they fund your DAO?

> Is it top down (grants)? Bottom up (Moloch)? Do stakeholders pay subscription (membership dues)? Etc..

Options to discuss:

- **Grants**

Lots of money available from big players in the Web3 ecosystem for building public goods, writing content etc.

- **Outside funding** (SeedClub, Traditional VCs)

Ecosytem forming for DAO's investing in other DAOs. Essentially taking a bet on the people involved and their stated mission/values/goals.

- **Inside funding**

Provide opportunity for community members to allocate funding to the DAO as the believe in it (we need to be tracked for future allocation/rewards)

- **Bounties**

Companies offering bounties for work they do not have the talent to do themselves.

- **On-chain revenue** (i.e. NFT sales)
