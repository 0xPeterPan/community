# Simple DAO Canvas

## Core

### Name your DAO

DeveloperDAO

### Describe the DAO’s goals as explicitly as possible

> Take a moment to condense it into a clear and concise sentence.

### Top 3 expected principles of this organization

- TBD

- TBD

- TBD

### Which decisions/systems can the DAO control?

> Budget allocation? hiring? investments? all of the above?

### What problem do you seek to solve by deploying as a DAO?

> What will using a DAO enable that would not be possible with a traditional entity or platform?

### How would the world change if this DAO is successful?

> Think big!

### What is needed to achieve your goals with this DAO?

> Try to focus on the things you want to happen, not any specific tool or framework.

<br />

## Community

### What is the project’s backstory?

> Why are you here? Why are you building a DAO? Why should people care? People love stories!

### Communication platforms

> Define the “watering holes” of your community and their purpose.

- **Daily chatting:** _Discord, Telegram, etc.._

- **Knowledge repository:** _GitHub, blog, newsletters, etc.._

### Community’s rhythms and rituals:

> Meetups, videocalls, blogposts, podcasts, AMAs with members, etc..

- **Weekly:** _Ex: a communty call or something?_

- **Monthly:** _Ex: a regular time to make budgetting proposals?_

### Who is responsible?

> Who are the people or organizations responsible and who keeps the pulse of the rituals.

### Member journey

#### Describe the new user onboarding process

> How do people discover and join your DAO?

#### How do new users catch up?

> Getting started page, calls to action, newsletter, etc..

#### How do you keep users engaged?

> Why should people stick around after discovering your DAO?

#### How does a user leave? Why might they do so?

> Both good and bad reasons.

<br />

## Governance elements

### Key performance indicators

> What are you optimizing for?

- \# or % active users (per week)

- \# of proposals made/passed (per week)

- Any other concrete outputs you're looking for?

### Reflect on these governance polarities

- Global <> the organization’s physical infrastructure <> Local

- Decentralized <> how distributed amongst people is its decision making <> Centralized

### Caps and global constraints

> Maximum total token holdings? Maximum burn rate of funds? What are users not allowed to do?

### Common proposals

> What are the decisions the DAO takes on a daily basis and are not considered critical?

### Critical proposals

> What are the critical decisions that the DAO can take that need a high degree of consensus?

### Legal strategy

> How does the DAO negotiate it’s legitimacy with the legacy legal system?

### Doubts and concerns on the parameters

> Questions, comments, and concerns go here.

<br />

## Stakeholder Analysis

### From the users’ point of view, what is the DAO’s primary objective?

> Should be one sentence or less.

### What connects your different user personas?

> They might share goals, ambitions, ideology, or just the same office. What is it?

### How do users coordinate strategy, planning and direction?

> Where/how does the community coordinate so that the DAO can operate in a peer to peer way?

### How can users leverage participation for individual benefit?

> What do people get out of the DAO? Connecting their needs/desires to the collective process is important to keep your users engaged.

### Describe your user personas:

> Think about their age, lifestyle, and goals.

- Persona 1

- Persona 2

- Persona 3

<br />

## Actors

### DAO functions

> What do you want your DAO to do?

- Manage assets

- Create community votes

- Curate content

- Create a marketplace

- etc..

### Ideal proposal types (brainstorm)

> These types will help determine who gets tokens and how.

Budget / funding:

- fundraising

- one off proposals

- monthly budgeting

- etc...

### If you plan on managing or allocating capital who are the funders? Why would they fund your DAO?

> Is it top down (grants)? Bottom up (Moloch)? Do stakeholders pay subscription (membership dues)? Etc..
