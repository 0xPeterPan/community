- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) has made it incredibly easy for Ethereum based communities, protocols, and Dapps to launch secure, off-chain voting for DAO Governance. This provides for some quick decentralization of governance for many projects.
- What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?
    - "An open-source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically execute certain actions without the need for intermediaries." [source](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao)
    - However, DAOs come in many forms. The community today accepts the term DAO on groups that have not yet built out many autonomous execution features, but still provide a decentralized governance mechanism where the results are carried out in clear view of everyone.
- DAO Governance Today
    - As mentioned, the community accepts DAOs that consist of a decentralized governance mechanism. This works by providing a clear and transparent voting structure to the community at hand. The voting structure will use a strategy that relies on decentralized blockchain ownership.
    - For example, an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet might be used as the voting power for DAO governance. Or, specific NFT ownership might give voting power for governance.
- On-chain vs. Off-chain Voting
    - Any governance mechanism must have a voting component. It is important that this is a trustless mechanism that relies on the security of the blockchain.
    - Initial governance mechanisms used "on-chain" voting, where participants would send a transaction to the blockchain as proof of a valid vote for or against a proposal. This resulted in a high-cost to any voting actions, and decreased the decentralization of the governing community as only high balances would vote.
    - Today, [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) (and other projects) are making it easy to hold off-chain voting. **First**, a __snapshot__ of voting power is taken at a specified block in time. **Second**, the addresses with voting power are able to sign their vote with their private key and have it stored in IPFS.
    - We can be sure that the votes recorded have come from those with the voting power as the private key is needed to sign the particular vote and this can be easily verified.
- Execution
    - Even though on-chain voting was prohibitively expensive, it allowed for easy on-chain execution of governance voting. This is now a little more difficult with off-chain voting. Even so, the increased decentralization and participation from off-chain voting make it the obvious choice for the industry today.
    - Projects are working on more easily connecting off-chain voting to on-chain execution. We should see solutions for this begin to be broadly used this year as the community DAO development sprint continues.
    - Today, many projects have a select group of members who carry out voting execution. Decentralization is a spectrum, and as technology increases we can continue to become more decentralized.
    - If a protocol or technology goes against the DAO governance, it will destroy the community and value of the application as it can be easily verified on the blockchain.
