# ‚è± Agenda

### Introduction
- Welcome
- This this is a meeting about the website and the direction we want to take it.
- Try to ID when things require outside input or clarification of the scope of the website group

### Action Item Review

1. ‚úÖ Need someone to take hold of the Gitcoin POC [github issue #64](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/developer-dao/issues/64)
2. Decision on if we should create a blog or post on an existing platform
3. ‚úÖ Create a repository for meeting minutes

### Issue Triage
- [Issues over a week since update](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/developer-dao/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+updated%3A%3C2021-09-16) (Note the querystring for date of update)

### Design
- [Base Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBxYJrArJFOpND9c4OBWkY/D_D?node-id=37%3A3) has been created (thanks `@codingwithmanny#0205`)
  - People can create their own copy in order to work on design(s)
- Other larger topics were brought up in the previous notes
  - Brand Guidelines
  - Design as Bounty
  - Design elements need to be better defined
    - Explain how others can use design elements

### Managing New Features
- How to merge changes faster
- Document those with rights (identify constraint)
  - Github
  - Vercel

### Eth Domain
- `@mannyoloswag#7791` hodling the developerdao.eth domain until we have use for it and will transfer to community
- Need a plan for that address
  - Main domain
  - Subdomain for users (how managed?)
  - Address for DAO Treasury

### Proposed Features Projects
- `@codingwithmanny#0205` Project Codename Redlight Greenlight
- `@codingwithmanny#0205` Project Codename Self Conscious Token
- Vercel Analytics Access for all (most? some?)

#### Forum
- Has been topic of conversation on discord; sounds like the plan is to use existing but not official.
- Pending an unexpected decision to host on the website, out of scope of this group
- Refer to the discourse channel on Discord

#### Job Board
- DAO2DAO to differentiate from existing offerings (Braintrust)
- Clarity needed on [Pallet](https://pallet.xyz) as brought up by `@Parkerhendo#5828` [on discord](https://discord.com/channels/883478451850473483/883705562850807808/888886395572207706)

#### Learning Platform
- ?

#### Gitcoin
- [Issue in progress](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/developer-dao/issues/64), appears to be stuck on a question
- Funding

### Social Media
