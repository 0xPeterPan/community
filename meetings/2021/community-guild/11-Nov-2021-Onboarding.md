## Inclusivity
- Getting people to speak up requires a demonstrated culture of safety
    - Michelle - moving people from the lurking stage to the active state requires a demonstration of a safe space and accountability. Reminders about how we treat each other. Also creating a place for easy reporting and knowing that it is going to be reviewed and it’s easy for people to do. Good to have an anonymous reporting form where they can choose to give their details or not. Important to deal with things publicly that are very public, but not good calling out people where it’s not needed.
        - with-heart - should we have specific roles/team to deal with these kind of challenges?
    - Michelle - as people are getting more involved, how can we bring these people into the community more by actively engaging with them?
- We don't want to put the burdern of solving these problems on already underrepresented members
    - We should refrain from calling people out/putting members on the spot
    - Michelle - done a lot of work in community building, particularly in tech and women in tech. One thing she has seen to be really effective is going out of your way to include people, don’t feel like you are annoying anyone by pinging people, it’s better to ping them rather than not.
        - This is often a more welcoming way to go about it

## Onboarding
- There's so much going on (and this is good), but we need to better articulate what the Developer DAO is about
    - Cogoo - what I learnt from the town hall was very different from the feeling I got whilst lurking in the server. It's challenging to understand what we’re actually doing with how things are currently set up, how can we get this message out better? Before the town hall I knew that this is a DAO that is working in the web3 space and there is a lot of trying to bring people to the forefront i.e. boost your content channel. There is this entity that is the Developer DAO and they want to showcase its members using it’s network effects. From the town hall, the scope of what we’re working on was clearly much bigger than just showcasing people’s content.
        - The feeling on Twitter was welcoming
        - What are we trying to do in this space?
        - Where the DAO is going?
        - The scope of what we're building is more than showing what our members are doing
- The Town-Hall was a good way to see what Developer DAO is really working on/what is happening
    - 'wow' this is what you're trying to acheive
    - opened up the possibilities of what we could possibly do
    - couldn't see this as much from the outside
- Can we better articulate what we are about on the DAOwiki, website, and other public-facing channels? (see [Marketing](#Marketing))
    - Nathan - we should use the platform to welcome people in, reiterate the rules and culture we’re trying to build in the DAO as well as shouting
    - Will - we haven’t spoken about our mission, values and goals.
- Michelle - some kind of tour for discovering discord that allows people to go on a journey, here the initial onboarding is OK but once you’re in it’s a LOT. Maybe we could record a loom view or something to give people an introduction, maybe.
    - Could we have an onboarding process walk-through video?
        - Loom video by community members
            - This is where 'xyz' happens
- POAP to encourage members to onboard new members
    - Noah - maybe we could have a buddies program where new people who have finished onboarding could show new people into the community and gain some kind of reward.
- Weekly onboarding meetings (2 time zones?)
    - Nathan - can we have onboarding calls at scheduled times for people to come in and ask questions, give people an intro into discord, discourse, snapshot, where to get started. Need to make sure that we’re inclusive.
    - We could create a role for this
- Use town halls to welcome new members
    - Reiterate our ideals and goals
        - This is a safe place
    - Update on things/news
    - Touch on interactivity & inclusivity

## Rules
- We should create a private place for accountability and reporting
    - Optionally anonymous
    - Make it easy and accessible (Google Docs - free)
    - Having a good space for feedback is important to keep this a safe place
    - If case gets filed, reiterate to Developer DAO details about the integrity of our space, rules & guidelines
- Manny - How do we set up repurcussions in phases? Is this a zero-tolerance policy?
    - #rules channel
- Community to give their feedback on Rules (see [Action Items](#action-items))
    - Allow community to add Rules to reinforce our ideals
    - Add a Season 0 Rules proposal to Discourse
    - [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) (for community reference)
- Brandon - the vibe is much better than a lot of other crypto servers so we should think carefully about how we maintain that. Might be a good idea to create a way to silence someone by assigning roles.


## Meetings
- we should try to make things asynchronous as best as possible
    - keeping everyone in the loop is crucial
    - replay town halls
    - alternating time zones
    - re-release POAPs
- Agendas are great before meetings/town halls
    - We can see who has spoken about and when
    - Help someone figure out what they want to be a part of
- Noah - we should ask people to give feedback who aren’t in this meeting right now, and give people a space to report these ideas

## Marketing
- Options for public facing media
    - Newsletter
        - Noah - newsletter could play a big role in this, the town hall is getting bigger and bigger every week, so we need to improve our asynchronous communication. This is really important for people in different timezones, we need to include people.
            - Could this help us move some noise away from Discord?
            - Community feedback - it is currently difficult to know what is going on
    - D_D Podcast

## Guilds
- What do the guilds do?
- How do we get people to join the guilds?
    - Nathan - how can we include people that don’t want to join Guilds
- Call to action for bringing people into guilds
    - Potential to have a separate onboarding processes per guild
- Look into having channel mods & tags per guilds of channels
    - BrandonFrulla - can we have roles that allow us to ping everybody that wants to be involved in particular topics?
