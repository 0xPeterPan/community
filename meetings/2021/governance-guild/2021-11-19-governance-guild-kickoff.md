**Duration:** 60-min

**Date:** November 19, 2021

**Time:** 8pm - 9pm UTC

- Welcome to the Governance Guild!
- What is Developer DAO?
    - Educate a new wave of web3 developers
    - Build awesome tools

## Agenda 
- 10 min: **Introduction to DevDAO + Governance Guild**
    - Including current governance review + new token (`$VIBES`, `$D4R`, `$DEVS`, `$BUIDL`, have been floated as ideas for token)
        - Governance is very important for the success of Developer DAO
            - Tokenomics, contributing reward, etc.
            - Currently we're using snapshot for voting
                - DAO token is voting token for now
                - 600 votes for Season 0 proposal
                - Can look into Quadratic & Ranked voting options
        - [Developer DAO Season 0](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p3-developer-dao-season-0/219)
            - Everyone in the DAO participates in the governance layer
        - There is no perfect way to move forward with current token - will look at a Governance Token
            - Need to leave room for partnerships & new members
            - Rewarding contributions, etc.
- 15 min: **Admin Conversation**
    - Channel setup
        - Tokenomics project moving to Governance Guild
    - Guild needs
        - New ideas and proposals
        - Will we determine what projects are pursued?
            - We will set structure up to facilitate proper governance
                - Documentation, Voting, Setup
            - Community guild will be one we work with frequently
                - As guilds work together, we need to have a system setup so that effective communication is possible
        - Someone to help with Governance information on Notion with `nathanng.eth`
    - Meeting schedule
        - how often do we want to meet?
            - bi-weekly offsetting the D_D Town Hall
            - alternating timezones weekly
- 15 min: **Season 0 Objectives**
    - Refine process for making proposals in the DAO, including clarity on what needs to be a proposal, threshold for a proposal to be made, and level of consensus required for different types of proposals.
        - What will need to be voted on and what will not?
            - Decision on motions involving the treasury should require vote
                - Anything that has a potential impact from the treasury standpoint
                    - Regarding Treasury: One of the core teams objectives during Season 0 was to deploy the treasury and secure initial funding (to be voted on). We've just done with this [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) and will be posting an overview of the owners/signers (basically currently core team members) to discourse in the next few days and during Season 0 and beyond we'll refine how the treasury is managed
        - Potential for designated, elected position to submit proposals
            - Progressive Decentralization could help us to avoid any authoritarian control - by `DOSWΞLL.ΞTH`
                - I invented a concept similar to representative democracy, but unique to another project (not D_D), I call progressive decentralization. Basically, you rotate governors and said governors must be elected by their Houses (for D_D, maybe their Guild members) to represent said Houses in a private channel. Votes are debated and passed in the main House, quarterly.
                - Everyone is encouraged to become a governor (that's not what we call it) at least once. The idea is not to have perpetual mods. We believe in maximizing decentralization to minimize counterparty risk. The difficult part is not the quarterly rotating governance scheme so much as scaling the number of root key holders. 
                - True decentralization with the above-mentioned filter means people are represented by governors, who do what they say. Root key holders do what governors say. If either root key holders or governors disobey, the people are encouraged to sell and/or exit. This would depreciate the price and disable operations. It keeps the power in the hands of the people, which is why onboarding, training, and good governance elections, are essential. Happy to talk more about how we do it.
        - Will be setting up the groundwork for functionality
        - Can we work to get sets of proposals bundled so that we are requiring less participation/voting?
            - This could help filter out what is relevant to go to the top
            - Executive decisions by key players may help us take necessary steps to bring in advisors or make decisions before opportunities are missed
                - Communicating ideas in public is crucial
                - Transparency is key, allowing others to chime in by learning in public
                - "Overcommunicate, but do not hesitate" `jw.kn`
                - Having some dedicated people to get process going while ensuring other people with different ideas and different background also get a chance to contribute
        - How do we have delegation?
        - How do we include people?
    - Setup and manage tooling for governance process.
        - [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) - will work with Community Guild for this project - power goes into the users hand
            - Can help facilitate cross-guild and multi-member collaboration
            - Also look into [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io)
            - Should be cautious of implementing tooling before we evaluate our options
        - Collect information about decentralized governance
    - Improve documentation around governance process & tooling use.
- 20 min: **Overflow, General Discussion, QA**
