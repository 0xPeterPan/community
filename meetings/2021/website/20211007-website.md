### Misc

### Closing

# üìù Notes

- Github feature request and bug report templates have been added to the website repo
- Direct Mint PR is nearly complete, just iterating based upon comments
- Issue #105 build issue is slowed down due to team members not having access to view Vercel build logs (may be related to html generating 88k vice 8k possible pages: space on the build?)

### üìã Attendees

- @gjsyme
- @Narb | 2669
- @Raz

### ‚úÖ Action items

- Get more people added to Vercel build access `@with-heart`/`@thomas`
- If not settled, determine if we want the i18n audit action in the repo or set out on its own action
- Revisit PR #4 with more people on the call
- Look at integration with DevDao mirror presence
  - just entering the write race implies that we have a Mirror account and Wallet now
