## Meeting Purpose
To coordinate ongoing development of the Developer DAO Knowledge Base

## Weekly Recap
- Last sync (Oct. 13), we discussed KB goals, scope, and tooling.  
- It was identified that a more robust solution was required to manage a growing list of resources

## Tooling Update
**Knowledge Base Platform**
- From last week's discussion, we decided to open the proposals up to the DAO to solicit more ideas from the community and encourage contribution.
- `@nathanng.eth` organized a Request For Proposals: [https://forum.developerdao.com/t/knowledge-base-tooling-request-for-proposals/132](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/knowledge-base-tooling-request-for-proposals/132)

RFP outcome:
- 3 proposals were submitted:
- `@kempsterrrr.eth` submitted a proposal for Airtable
- `@gjsyme` submitted a proposal for Supabase + Custom Front-end
- `@nathanng.eth` submitted a proposal for Notion

**Proposal Presentation**
1. Presentation led by `@kempsterrrr.eth` for Airtable
- `@kempsterrrr.eth` opened with a screenshare on the proposed Airtable structure
- Discussed Airtable flexibility and examples in the wild (DAOist)
- Discussed contribution tactics
- Discussed performance, curation, potential cost

2. Presentation led by `@gysyme` for Supabase + Custom Front-end
- `@gjsyme` opened with a screenshare to show dashboard of Supabase and its capabilities
- Discussed benefits of overall control and experience with this stack in the community
- Discussed building custom front-end based on the data

3. Presentation led by `@nathanng.eth` for Notion
- `@nathanng.eth` opened with a screenshare about Notion and example of how it would look like
- Discussed benefits of Notion's flexible database and pages and templates that it could use
- Discussed benefits of getting up and running quickly, but challenges of extensibility

4. Discussion led by `@Raz` who proposed using Strapi CMS (strapi.io) to power the content of the KB
- `@Raz` led the discussion talking about the ease of use in building on top of Strapi
- `@marc` helped afterwards by getting a live demo setup
- `@nathanng.eth` included the unofficial proposal in the poll

**Open Discussion**
Other considerations that we should take when building the KB:

Risk of Data Centralization
- Since we're using 3rd-party systems to build this on top of, we have the risk of "centralizing" our data
- If a service like Airtable / Notion go down, what are the ramifications?
- Suggestion to have regular backups and potentially using static sites / cached data on the front-end

**Vote**
- Voting will start once the poll opens on Discourse
- Voting will close automatically on Fri. Oct. 22 @ 1500 UTC
- Voting is open to all members of the DAO (will need a Discourse account)

## Next Steps
1. `@nathanng.eth` to create poll on Discourse thread
2. `@nathanng.eth` to organize vote submissions, announcements, and set up potential structure for next week's KB sync
