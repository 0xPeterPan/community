## Meeting Purpose
To coordinate ongoing development of the Developer DAO Knowledge Base

## Current Status
The Developer DAO Knowledge Base exists as a GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Developer-DAO/resources

Currently, the knowledge base includes articles, tutorials, and links to videos, documentation, books, interactive games, courses, and other helpful resources.

To contribute:
- Members can initiate a pull request

## Goals
The knowledge base goals should be in alignment with the Developer DAO Manifesto Goals (see [latest](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/community/blob/278f31196a029ae8dc7c9c55fbad6723cf8f7db2/dao-canvas-template.md#describe-the-daos-goals-as-explicitly-as-possible)):
- Educate and Support Web3 Developers

Breaking this down, the knowledge base should:
- Onboard new developers and web2 developers
- Support current web3 developers in helping them grow in their journey
- Become a central source of resources about web3 development

## Scope
The knowledge base should provide:
- Terminology
- Roadmap (learning)
- Concepts
- Content (courses, tutorials, articles)
- Tools
- Documentation
- Examples

The knowledge base can be broken down by:
- Developer Level (new developer, web3 beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Technology (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, etc.)
- Use Case (DAOs, DeFi, Art, Learning, Productivity, etc.)
- Learning medium (video, article, interactive course, etc.)

The knowldge base should be:
- Exhaustive but curated (to quote @Dhaiwat10)

## Tooling
**Knowledge Base Platform**

Knowledge Base is currently in the form of markdown on a GitHub repo.

Challenge:
- As the repo grows with more and more resources, it will make it harder for people to find content that is relevant to them
- Even though there is some structure, it may not serve the purposes of "guiding a developer" through their onboarding journey

A platform with a database was suggested so that we can have a comprehensive list of resources with structure, labels, etc.

Additional requirements:
- External / Public API so that we can build a front-end on top of it, for curation / other reasons
- Output to GitHub repo
- Export in case we need to switch platforms
- Form input so that we can encourage better collaboration
- Integration into contribution platform (TBD pending formalization of contribution mechanism - tokens, etc.)

Options:
  1. Use AirTable as the "database
        - (suggestion from @kempsterrrr) 
  2. Use Notion as the database and knowledge base
        - (suggestion from @achilles @tawseef and others)
  3. Build database on Supabase (or other custom integration)
        - (suggestion from @gjsyme)  

Actions:
- @ngnathan to kick-off thread on Discourse opening the invite for proposals
- @kempsterrrr is leading proposal for Airtable
- @ngnathan is leading proposal for Notion
- Open invite for any other contributions!

## Questions
Should the knowledge base be **exhaustive and comprehensive**, or **curated and condensed**?
- General consensus that it should be "exhaustive but curated", perhaps powered with a database and then curated on top
- @gjsyme: Example: "Best solidity guide" then "other guides"
- @kempsterrrr: Content curators will eventually be needed

Should we promote content from members of the DAO?
- @Dhaiwat10: Should strive to create a high-quality KB that's unbiased
- Suggestion from @gjsyme to put a D_D label on their content
- Newsletters or blog posts, if officially from the DAO, could be treated in a special way and curated as necessary (pending Editorial team decisions)

Should we do a 1-pager or break out by sections?
How do we prioritize / sort content?
- TBD until platform has been selected

How do we support questions (and answers) from the community?
- Having the ability to ask questions will be really helpful and quite powerful
- Could be separated into learning path questions (How do I build my first app on Web3) vs. specific questions (How do you handle mathematical operators in Solidity)
- Could be really powerful from a search perspective and promoting the DAO
- Comments from @achilles @kempsterrrr @gjsyme

Do we build our own interactive courses?
- TBD for a later discussion
- Knowledge Base for now should be a comprehensive place for anyone to learn about Web3 Development

## Initiatives
1. Content Development
- Ongoing contributions from community via Pull Requests on GitHub repo
- Building an exhaustive list of resources (contributions by the community) can be promoted after platform has been selected
- Learning roadmap (Commented by @kempsterrrr @Dhaiwat10 @with-heart `@Emanuel | (0x4ae)`) could be very useful to build (no one working on this yet)

2. Front-end website integration
Options:
- Option 1: Create a GitHub pages or alternative to use repo as the front-end
- Option 2: Design and build our own front-end integration (perhaps directly on the developerdao.com repo)

TBD until platform has been selected, since curated resouces will be dependent on API from platform

## Next Steps
1. @ngnathan to start Discourse thread on selecting a platform to power the database of the Knowledge Base
- @kempsterrrr @achilles and any others are free to submit a proposal
- Timeline: Thread to be started by 2021-10-15, Proposals submitted by 2021-10-20, Votes / Selection by 2021-10-22
