# Developer DAO Knowledge Base 2021-10-13

## Details
<strong>Time:</strong> 30-min

<strong>Meeting Purpose:</strong> To coordinate ongoing development of the Developer DAO Knowledge Base

## Agenda
- Current Status of Knowledge Base and latest updates
- Knowledge Base Goals
- Scope
- Tooling
- Initiatives
- Outstanding Questions

## Goals
The knowledge base goals should be in alignment with the Developer DAO Manifesto Goals (see [latest](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/community/blob/278f31196a029ae8dc7c9c55fbad6723cf8f7db2/dao-canvas-template.md#describe-the-daos-goals-as-explicitly-as-possible)):
- Educate and Support Web3 Developers

Breaking this down, the knowledge base should:
- Onboard new developers and web2 developers, and support current web3 developers in their journey
- Provide easy concise access to the universe of resources around web3

## Scope
The knowledge base should provide:
- Terminology
- Roadmap (learning)
- Concepts
- Content (courses, tutorials, articles)
- Tools
- Documentation
- Examples

The knowledge base **could** be broken down by:
- Developer level (new developer, web3 beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Technology (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, etc.)
- Use Case (DeFi, Art, Learning, Productivity, etc.)
- Learning medium (video, article, interactive course, etc.)

The knowldge base **should** be:
- Comprehensive (?)
- Concise (?)

To discuss:
- How do we prioritize / sort content?
- How do we promote DDAO Member (or DAO) content? (Newsletters, YouTube Videos, etc.)
- Do we build our own interactive courses? (is that a separate discussion)?

## Notes

### Tooling
**Knowledge Base Platform**

Knowledge Base is currently in the form of markdown on a GitHub repo.
- Suggestions:
  1. (from @kempsterrr) AirTable similar to DAOists
  2. (from @achilles) Set up KB on Notion

- Should we do a 1-pager or break out by sections?

### Initiatives
1. Ongoing KB Contribution
- Initiate a pull request to contribute to the Developer DAO Knowledge Base Repo

2. Front-end website integration
- Option 1: Create a GitHub pages or alternative to use repo as the front-end
- Option 2: Design and build our own front-end integration (perhaps directly on the developerdao.com repo)
