# ‚è± Agenda

## Introduction
- Kickoff call for the concept of an on-chain resume

## Design
- Interface concept is TBD, @rahat taking the lead on generating something
  - @miral going to be looped in (actual design experience)

## Managing New Features
- Starting from scratch, it's pretty open ended for now
- Will revisit this once we've pinned down what we're doing

## Proposed Features Projects
- Everything (brand new project)
- From the notes
  - User will be able to build and maintain a profile of themselves on the chain.
    - Capture basic information (like the ceramic basicProfile)
    - Capture educational experience
    - Capture development experience (professional/educational/personal)
    - Capture professional experience (employment or the like)
  - Will require some custom schema to expand upon `basicProfile` and `addresses`
  - Ability to View and Edit the profile
  - Ability to check if a user (ETH and polygon addresses) has NFTs for completion of educational tasks in:
    - _buildspace
    - questbook
  - Ability to get some data via oracle (off-chain data brought on chain)
    - Github comes to mind but we did not specify
  - Copy the stack used by developerdao.com for ease of D_D members


## Misc

- This has potential to be essential to the worker/employee side of the job board

## Closing

# Notes

## concept
no central source of truth for on chain work
on-chain data and verification is not available currently
platform for quickly sharing the work that you've done
ability to connect multiple wallets to your account
ability to (control access and) share with potential employers, etc
completion of bounties, courses, and work (launched contracts etc)

ability to track mainnet and other-net work done too

## MVP is the build and view of that core personal profile
- any user can build a profile for themselves (if they have a wallet)

Profile
- ideally the data is portable (on chain like ceramic DID based data)
  - start from ceramic `basicProfile` and `addresses`
  - add custom schema for required additional data
- have a custom personal data section
- have an educational profile
- have a professional profile (might not be MVP)

Webapp
- view page for a profile based on an input address
- edit page for your profile (assuming logged in with your wallet)
  - do your basicProfile
  - add your addresses
- education profile stuff should also include some manner of free text entry to cover meatspace education
- tech stack: copy paste from developerdao.com
  - next
  - react
  - chakra
  - next-i18next
  - ...whatever we're using with our web3 integration

### education profile
- _buildspace
- questbook
- off-chain data as a proof of oracle work (maybe a step too far, but github)

### custom personal data
- ceramic `basicProfile` plus `addresses`
- whatever other data we need (if there is other data we need)

## if we want to build something, we should see if there can be a standard like humans.txt for web3
### issues forseen
- working in a team and only 1 person gets the deploy credit
- work on a repo that the team is anonymous on
  - obvious answer here is don't try to claim anonymous work
- i think we don't have to try to solve this entirely (as it's a part of resume considerations that people live with anyway (i===`@gjsyme`))

## research considerations
- lots of educational NFTs are built on polygon, see if we can capture that in The Graph
  - legacy explorer has support
- questbook has an interest in this kind of thing existing; should reengage as we get an MVP built
