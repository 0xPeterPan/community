# DeveloperDAO Townhall # 1

This townhall was organised at very short notice so we apologies to anyone who was not available at the time.

Very open format exploring the topics those persent thought were most pressing for the commmunity to start looking into further. Below is a summary of points discussed and their actions items.

## Regular Weekly Community Meeting

Discussed the importance of having a regular meeting where everyone can gather to update on what is happening in the DAO, discuss broader topics that impact everyone involved and agree actions to move the DAO forward.

For meeting time, we settled on suggesting 5pm UTC to the community on either Friday, Saturday or Sunday, and taking a vote via emoji reactions.

Actions:

- `mod` to post message to @everyone suggestion the above and take a vote on best opiton.

**NB** If the suggested time is not feasible for you please make the community aware in `#community-imporvement` and we can work together to try to find something that suits as many people as possible.

## Regular meetings for Projects

Related to the challenge below (onboarding) and also general collaboration, agreed projects would find regular times to meet to discuss and we'd store these times somewhere that is easily accessible for the community so people know when they're happening and can join to participate or just listen.

Actions:

- Each projcet decide a regular weely meeting time
- `nagma.eth` to look into a way to display community events in open and easily discoverable way

## Onboarding

It was raised that onboarding for new members could be improved, some foudn it difficult to understand how they could get involved and contribute so ultimately ended up not doing so.

Argeed `kempsterrrr.eth | dev 1948` and `nagma.eth | #2289` would take a look to see if we can improve this now we have accecss to bot configuration in thhe serevr settings. Will update and updated next townhall.

Actions:

- `nagma.eth` & `kempsterrrr.eth` to see if we can improve onboarding flow further using bots

## Governance in the DAO

Discussed at length. Acknowledged that this is a very broad and important topic for the commmunity which will impact/is impacted by other decisions we'll need to make such as issuing a token and the impact this has on ownership/voting process if/when we do this.

For now it was agreed that `dhaiwat` and `kempsterrrr.eth` would get a discourse server up and research a standard template for making proposals into the DAO so we have somewhere to begin proposing ideas and discussing their merit in a more organised way than discord channels.

Also aim to organise an open call this week to discuss Governance and the tooling around it more broadly. `kempsterrrr.eth` will update on this tomorrow, Sunday 19th.

Actions:

- `dhaiwat` & `kempsterrrr.eth` to deploy community discourse server
- Organise initiall call before next Town Hall to discuss what we need to start looking into re Governance and tooling to suppor this (`willblackburn.eth` has a proposed agenda for this)

## Organising learning resources

There are a lot of really useful resources being shared in various different channels. Agreed it would be a good idea to create a community repo to organise these resources to make them more easily discoverable for everyone.

Action:

- `with-love` to create `resources` GitHub repo (Need volunteers to begin working out how to organise this)

## Events

`Dhaiwat` raised the idea of hosting events for the community using a discord `Stage` channel. This could be talks from people in the Web3 space or even workshops, very open ideas at this point in time, but would be good value add for the community. `NoahH` and `Sandipan` both mentioned they work in Devrel and would be happy to look into putting something together.

Actions:

- `NoahH` to look into events they may be abel to organise in partnership with his work: [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
- `Sandipan` to look into events they may be abel to organise in partnership with his work: [Polyglon](https://polygon.technology/)
- `nagma.eth` to look into bots that can help with organising an notifying everyone about events

## Documenting our journey

`with-love` raised the idea of documenting our journey setting up the DAO publically as a way to help othersr who are in a similar situation now, or in the future, figure out how they can organise in this way as well. To get this moving we need somewhere the community can post updates on what we're doing, suggested options were `medidum` and `mirror.xyz`

No clear actions set for this yet.

## Access to DAO Twitter Handle

`Eknobl` raised that it would be good for the community to have the ability to use the DAO twitter handle for announcing events. Assumed this currently sits with Nader and we'd need tp speak with him to secure access and only provide this to specific people who the community agrees take on this repsonsibility.

## Other topics listed to keep track of

- Plan for tokenisation and i's implications
- Tracking and rewarding contributions
- Other basic infra for DAO (multi sig wallet, voting, etc. likely part of Governance chat this week)
