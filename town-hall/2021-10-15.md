## Notes

- POAPs available for this town hall, but limited quantities due to POAP service issues.
- $WRITE Race
  - We won! Finished 6th; top 10 receive a $WRITE token which can be burned to receive privileged access to Mirror.
  - Mirror dev `indreams.eth` provided insight into the platform and potential future that Developer DAO could help shape via governance as a $WRITE token earner.
- Moving forward as a DAO
  - Mission, values, and goals proposal were created last week and tweaked based on feedback. [Latest version](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-2-defining-our-mission-values-and-goals/137) is up for final review before a Snapshot vote.
  - Mission, values, goals unlock other doors: everything from website content to external collaborations.
  - [Season 0 proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/how-we-move-forward-as-a-dao-season-0/56/27) has received some great feedback as well; giving that more time to integrate into a final proposal. Please weigh in!
  - Announcements will be made when voting is open on these topics.
- Project updates
  - Website:
    - Translators still needed.
    - Have been waiting on mission/goals/values to move forward on content.
  - Derivatives:
    - Nice "usage" and excitement around the avatars by DAO members!
    - More contributors stepping up.
    - Launch/mint details still TBD.
    - Already considering follow-up derivative projects, like games.
    - Sunday meetings may get rescheduled; stay tuned in the #derivatives channel.
  - Knowledge base:
    - Uptick in contributions.
    - Big item is selecting the right tool for hosting all our resource data. A [request for proposals](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/knowledge-base-tooling-request-for-proposals/132) is up in the forum.
    - Weekly sync likely to be scheduled for Wednesdays at 15:00 UTC.
  - Other mentioned opportunities:
    - [job board concept](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/job-board-concept/35)
    - [on-chain resume concept](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/on-chain-work-resume-concept/39/10)
- Merch was mentioned in chat this week and brought up here. Potentially something for designers in the DAO to drum up some ideas. A `#merch` channel was created.
- Nader mentioned collab discussion with Radicle, possible token exchange. More discussion required.
- Events/conferences:
  - Aiming to have a virtual conf in Season 0 or 1.
  - Already some interest from the community to hvae sponsor materials to share with their orgs.
  - Mention of "hackathon" elicits excitement, but no steps taken there yet.
